# Search
My first project (A Google homepage replica)

Google Search replicates the main Google.com page. A search done on the site is just like a search done on the main Google site (https://www.google.com).

Google Image Search let's you search for only images, just like using https://www.google.com/imghp

Google Advanced Search let's you search with more Advanced options. (https://www.google.com/advanced_search)
